# RTC Multiboot

This is an edited decompilation of the "Berry Program" multiboot image which comes compressed within Pokémon Emerald. It is a patch for the [berry glitch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Berry_glitch) that exists in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire.

It builds the following ROM:

* berry_fix.gba `sha1: 2eb0a94a913bebfb4cb59ceb57f3f965da55ef6d `
